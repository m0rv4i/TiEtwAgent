# TiEtwAgent

This project was build to research, build and test different memory injection detection usecases utilizing Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence event tracing provider, as a more modern and stable alternative to Userland-hooking, with the benefit of Kernel-mode visibility. The project uses the [microsoft/krabsetw](https://github.com/microsoft/krabsetw) library for ETS setup and consumption.
